# New in version 2.0.x
- Cross-platform support. The application now runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
- Complete overhaul of the UI. The UI is now more user-friendly and easier to navigate.
- Added the ability to open a combat log file at a specific line number using notepad++. Simply use the Log Review window, and click on the timestamp of the log you want to review. It'll open notepad++ and take you directly to the line you clicked in Orbs.
- Direct integration to Orbs-Stats.com. You can now view the leaderboard for a given encounter by right-clicking on the encounter in the Battles list.
- Death Review is now accessed directly via a button under the entry of a failed boss fight in the Battles list.
- Improved visibility of your local character's name in all overlays
- Added Icons to Timer Bars
- Improved timer functionality for non-english clients

##TODO
